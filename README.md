## Problem :frowning:
Being in a foreign land, brings a lot of anxiety and confusion. 

How might we lower the barrier of entry to ease the difficulty in transitioning while having a support structure?

## Target Users :dart:
- Singaporeans who just moved to a new country or staying for a long period of time.

## Pain points to address :worried:
- Difficult to make meaningful relationships and make friends from a fresh start.
- Singaporeans missing local food.
- No trusted resource for a local Singaporean community to celebrate festivals and reminisce home.
- Home sickness
- Information overload

## Goals :star:
- Finding a community who comes from the same culture as you and using that as a launch pad in creating relationships from both within and outside the Singaporean community.
- Locating authentic local Singaporean food, reviewed by true blue Singaporeans for Singaporeans.
- Provide a holistic support structure to ease transistion.
